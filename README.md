# bolt multifunction

this is a (big) script for sphero bolt robot making many functions at once.

and here is a list of functions:
- "screensaver" while plugging bot to power (two types of clock, working using real time)
- function to come back after throwing
- after spinning goes in random direction
- contains sounds (requires desktop/mobile speakers to be turned on, bolt doesnt have any sadly ;-; )

customizable things:
- clock colors and timezone (ofcourse)
- speed and distance of "journey" from either throw or spinnn
- more to come !

how to use?

copy paste contents of (main.js)[main.js] file to empty project in sphero app.
modify variables (top of the file) to setup.
thats all.

note: this script works only in sphero bolt robot, not any other spheros due to required display.
